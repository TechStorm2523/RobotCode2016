*How to Calibrate PID:
 - PD is the most basic way to change how fast the arm moves to target. 
 	High values make it go at full power until just before the right place;
 	Low values make it slow down well before (possibly too far before -- this is what PI (Integral) is for)
 - PI controls how much the arm will react to a long time running.
 	High values make the arm move very past and possibly overshoot if it has been running for any long time.
 	Low values mean the arm will stop before the target and take a long time before they start moving again. 
 		It also may go too far and take to long to go back again

MOST AUTO COMMANDS - LOOK AT TIMES/DISTANCES IN
RobotMap.java

TargetTracker.java
	ALL Target geometry must be based on theory
	HUE_RANGE, SAT_RANGE, VAL_RANGE - LOOK at http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24194/l/288985-identifying-and-processing-the-targets
										and set based using parameters in SmartDashboard to see how if affects tracking.
										(make sure you put final values in the constants) 
										SHOULD BE GOOD FOR NOW
	(DONE) CAMERA_FOV Camera Field of View, can be found by math + measurements - See https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24194/l/288985-identifying-and-processing-the-targets#Distance
	CAMERA_ELEVATION - Simply Camera Angle (BE PRECISE)
	
ArmPivot.java
	ARM_STARTING_ANGLE - the angle off horizontal that the arm is zero (starts) at. Set precisely, this controls the winch retraction
	POTENTIOMETER_START_DEGREE - The angle on the potentiometer the arm starts at
	MAX_IN_MATCH_ANGLE - Max Angle (potentiometer) to be under height limit (experimentally determined)
	ARM PID Coefficents (PID_KP and PID_KI)
	
DriveTrain.java
	Turn PID (TURN_KP and TURN_KI)
	Drive PID (DRIVE_KP and DRIVE_KI)
	DISTANCE_PER_ENCODER_PULSE - Distance robot travels for an encoder pulse
	TARGET_DISTANCE_TOLERANCE - How far off from a target distance the robot will be satisfied that it's on target
							too low may take a while to hit or NOT hit, too high will be imprecise
	
Winch.java
	(DONE) ARM_PIVOT_TO_15IN Distance to 15 inch from pivot center (May want to less than 15in for leway
	RPM_PER_INCH_PER_SECOND Power per feed rate in in/sec - need to measure emprically 
		(easiest way is to hook up to average charge battery/ run at full to see what inch/sec is at that (full) speed
		 , and enter 1 / INCH/SEC into this constant with that value, where the 1 represents full power (.5 is half, etc.)
		 ALSO - multiply THIS by random coefficents to calibrate ARM MOVEMENT!!
		 
	MAX_WINCH_BY_ARM_ANGLE - set to angle that cable starts to slack (when arm is FULLY extended too)
	
LauncherWheels.java
	RPM PID - Just PID_KP
	ENCODER_REV_PER_PULSE - the number of wheel revolutions per encoder pulse (of which there are usually 360)
							(can be found mathematically w/ gearboxes)
	MAX_RPM - The max RPM the motor is capable of -- used to tell whether in range (WE HAVE THEORETICALLY)
	RPM_PER_VELOCITY - Conversion factor to go from velocity to rpm - HAS BEEN CALCULATED THEORETICALLY, multiply to 
						by some value to match what you see. (ALSO, we measure speed based on the SLOWER wheel on the shooter,
						so you may have to average the value OR change the model in the code (which will be hard))
						(see back of trajectory calculations in shooter box)
	LAUNCH_ANGLE - shooter launch angle
	LAUNCH_HEIGHT - height of ROBOT launch (to center of ball approx.)
	TARGET_HEIGHT
	TARGET_RPM_TOLERANCE - just how far off from a target RPM the robot will be satisfied that it's on target
							too low may take a while to hit or NOT hit, too high will be imprecise
	CAM_DISTANCE_OFF_LAUNCH - Distance of camera off center of ball at launch
							
SeekTarget.java - NOT super important, hopefully never used much
	SEEK_SPEED - Speed to seek target at
	FIRST_TURN_TIME - Time to turn for during initial turn
	MAX_TURN_TIME - Length of turn (after turn has ramped up in length) at which to stop turning
	TURN_TIME_INCREMENT - Increment of time spent turning after each sweep is completed
